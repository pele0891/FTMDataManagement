Product TimeLine Compiler
==========================
This program takes a product name and a CTU date in form of a excel file then compiles a visual stack area graph.
The day zero is placed on the CTU date and is computed by splitting the template timeline in half.
The file dataRead.py takes in template data under sheet 'dB' and takes in user data in sheet 'productdB', which is both under the productdB.xlsx file.
==========================
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
The span of the template is 54 months. The current range is from January 2022 to August 2026
As long as the length of the timeline is changed all other values may be altered
NOTE - when changing dates in excel inputting say '1/22' will automatically be converted to '1/1/22'
    -to fix -> select range of cells, select format cells, select 'Text'
Day 0 is computed to have a headcount of 21.75
When inputting a date into productdB, there must be a corresponding date in dB
